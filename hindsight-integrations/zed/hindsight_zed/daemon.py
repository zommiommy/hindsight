"""The Hindsight Zed daemon.

Zed exposes no AI-conversation hook, so a small background process supplies the
automation:

  - **Auto-recall (passive injection):** when a thread is updated, recall memory
    against its latest user message and rewrite the fenced ``<!-- HINDSIGHT -->``
    block in that project's instruction file. Zed always includes that file in
    the agent's context, so memory "just shows up" on the next turn.
  - **Auto-retain (passive capture):** when a thread advances, store its
    transcript into the project's Hindsight bank.

Both sides poll the same ``threads.db`` so a single pass over new/changed
threads drives recall and retain together.
