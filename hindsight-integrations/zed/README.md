# hindsight-zed

Long-term memory for the [Zed](https://zed.dev) editor's AI assistant, powered by
[Hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight).

`hindsight-zed init` wires Zed's Agent Panel to the Hindsight **MCP server** and
adds a rule telling the agent to use it — so it recalls relevant memory at the
start of a task and retains durable facts as it goes. Recall happens at query
time against your actual message (no lag), and from your seat it's automatic.

## How it works

Zed has no pre-prompt hook, but it does support two things this integration uses:

- **MCP context servers** — Zed runs MCP servers configured under
  `context_servers` in `settings.json` and exposes their tools in the Agent
  Panel. We register the Hindsight MCP server there, giving the agent
  `recall` / `retain` / `reflect` tools.
- **A global instructions file** (`~/.config/zed/AGENTS.md`) that Zed includes in
  every conversation. We add a small rule there telling the agent to recall
  first and retain what it learns.

Zed doesn't yet have native HTTP-MCP transport, so the server is connected
through the [`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) stdio bridge
(run via `npx`) — that means you need Node.js installed.

## Install

```bash
pip install hindsight-zed
hindsight-zed init --api-token YOUR_HINDSIGHT_API_KEY --bank-id my-memory
```

`init` adds the `hindsight` MCP server to `~/.config/zed/settings.json` and the
recall/retain rule to `~/.config/zed/AGENTS.md`. Restart Zed, open the Agent
Panel, and the `hindsight` server should show a green dot.

Use a [Hindsight Cloud](https://hindsight.vectorize.io) key, or point at a
self-hosted server with `--api-url http://localhost:8888` (no token needed for an
open local server).

> If your `settings.json` contains comments (JSONC), `init` won't rewrite it —
> it prints the exact `context_servers` entry for you to paste instead. Use
> `hindsight-zed init --print-only` any time to see the snippet without writing.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `hindsight-zed init` | Add the MCP server + recall/retain rule |
| `hindsight-zed status` | Show whether the server + rule are configured |
| `hindsight-zed uninstall` | Remove the server + rule |
| `hindsight-zed init --print-only` | Print the config to add manually |

## What gets written

`~/.config/zed/settings.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "context_servers": {
    "hindsight": {
      "source": "custom",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y", "mcp-remote",
        "https://api.hindsight.vectorize.io/mcp/my-memory/",
        "--header", "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_HINDSIGHT_API_KEY"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

`~/.config/zed/AGENTS.md` (inside a fenced `<!-- HINDSIGHT -->` block that leaves
the rest of the file untouched): a short rule telling the agent to `recall` at
the start of each task and `retain` durable facts.

## Configuration

| Setting | Env var | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API URL | `HINDSIGHT_API_URL` | `https://api.hindsight.vectorize.io` |
| API token | `HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN` | _(none; required for Cloud)_ |
| Bank id | `HINDSIGHT_ZED_BANK_ID` | `zed` |

These can also live in `~/.hindsight/zed.json` (written by `init`).

## Development

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest tests -v -m 'not requires_real_llm'   # deterministic suite
uv run pytest tests -v -m requires_real_llm          # gated MCP-endpoint check
```
