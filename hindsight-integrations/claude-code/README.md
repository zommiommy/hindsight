# Hindsight Memory Plugin for Claude Code

Biomimetic long-term memory for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) using [Hindsight](https://vectorize.io/hindsight). Automatically captures conversations and intelligently recalls relevant context — a complete port of [`hindsight-openclaw`](../openclaw/) adapted to Claude Code's hook-based plugin architecture.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Add the Hindsight marketplace and install the plugin
claude plugin marketplace add vectorize-io/hindsight
claude plugin install hindsight-memory

# 2. Configure your LLM provider for memory extraction
# Option A: OpenAI (auto-detected)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"

# Option B: Anthropic (auto-detected)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"

# Option C: No API key needed (uses Claude Code's own model — personal/local use only)
# See: https://vectorize.io/hindsight/developer/models#claude-code-setup-claude-promax
export HINDSIGHT_LLM_PROVIDER=claude-code

# Option D: Connect to an external Hindsight server instead of running locally
mkdir -p ~/.hindsight
echo '{"hindsightApiUrl": "https://your-hindsight-server.com"}' > ~/.hindsight/claude-code.json

# 3. Start Claude Code — the plugin activates automatically
claude
```

That's it! The plugin will automatically start capturing and recalling memories.

## Features

- **Auto-recall** — on every user prompt, queries Hindsight for relevant memories and injects them as context (invisible to the chat transcript, visible to Claude)
- **Auto-retain** — after every response (or every N turns), extracts and retains conversation content to Hindsight for long-term storage
- **Knowledge tools** — MCP server exposing `agent_knowledge_*` tools for managing knowledge pages (list, get, create, update, delete), searching memories, and ingesting documents
- **Subagents with memory** — create specialized subagents with long-term memory via the `/hindsight-memory:create-agent` skill
- **Daemon management** — can auto-start/stop `hindsight-embed` locally or connect to an external Hindsight server
- **Dynamic bank IDs** — supports per-agent, per-project, or per-session memory isolation
- **Channel-agnostic** — works with Claude Code Channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack) or interactive sessions
- **Zero dependencies** — hooks are pure Python stdlib; MCP server requires the `mcp` pip package

## Subagents with Memory

Create specialized subagents that learn and build knowledge across sessions.

### Creating an agent

Just tell Claude:

> "Create a code review agent using /hindsight-memory:create-agent"

Claude will:
1. Ask for the agent name and description
2. Write the subagent file to `~/.claude/agents/`
3. Ingest any seed content you provide
4. Create initial knowledge pages

The agent appears in `/agents` and Claude auto-delegates to it based on its description, or you can mention `@agent-name` directly.

### Knowledge Tools (MCP)

When `enableKnowledgeTools` is `true`, the plugin starts a local MCP server exposing these tools:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `agent_knowledge_list_pages` | List all knowledge pages |
| `agent_knowledge_get_page` | Read a specific page |
| `agent_knowledge_create_page` | Create a new page with a source query |
| `agent_knowledge_update_page` | Update a page's name or source query |
| `agent_knowledge_delete_page` | Delete a page |
| `agent_knowledge_recall` | Search memories |
| `agent_knowledge_ingest` | Ingest text content |
| `agent_knowledge_ingest_file` | Ingest a file from disk |
| `agent_knowledge_get_current_bank` | Get the current bank ID |

The bank ID is resolved automatically from the plugin config — tools never expose a `bank_id` parameter.

## Architecture

The plugin uses Claude Code hook events and an MCP server:

| Component | Event/Transport | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| `session_start.py` | `SessionStart` hook | Health check — verify Hindsight is reachable |
| `recall.py` | `UserPromptSubmit` hook | **Auto-recall** — query memories, inject as `additionalContext` |
| `retain.py` | `Stop` hook (async) | **Auto-retain** — extract transcript, POST to Hindsight |
| `session_end.py` | `SessionEnd` hook | Cleanup — stop auto-managed daemon if started |
| `mcp_server.py` | MCP stdio server | **Knowledge tools** — `agent_knowledge_*` tools for pages, recall, ingest |
| `create-agent` | Skill | **Agent creation** — `/hindsight-memory:create-agent` wizard |

### Library Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `lib/client.py` | Hindsight REST API client (stdlib `urllib`) |
| `lib/config.py` | Configuration loader (settings.json + env overrides) |
| `lib/daemon.py` | `hindsight-embed` daemon lifecycle (start/stop/health) |
| `lib/bank.py` | Bank ID derivation + mission management |
| `lib/content.py` | Content processing (transcript parsing, memory formatting, tag stripping) |
| `lib/state.py` | File-based state persistence with `fcntl` locking |
| `lib/llm.py` | LLM provider auto-detection for daemon mode |

### How Recall Works

1. User sends a prompt → `UserPromptSubmit` hook fires
2. Plugin resolves Hindsight API URL (external, local, or auto-start daemon)
3. Derives bank ID (static or dynamic from project context)
4. Composes query from current prompt + optional prior turns
5. Calls Hindsight recall API
6. Formats memories into `<hindsight_memories>` block
7. Outputs via `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` — Claude sees it, user doesn't

### How Retain Works

1. Claude responds → `Stop` hook fires (async, non-blocking)
2. Reads conversation transcript from Claude Code's JSONL file
3. Applies chunked retention logic (every N turns with sliding window)
4. Strips `<hindsight_memories>` tags to prevent feedback loops
5. Extracts text from channel messages (Telegram reply tool calls, etc.)
6. POSTs formatted transcript to Hindsight retain API

## Connection Modes

The plugin supports three connection modes, matching the Openclaw plugin:

### 1. External API (recommended for production)

Connect to a running Hindsight server (cloud or self-hosted). No local LLM needed — the server handles fact extraction.

```json
{
  "hindsightApiUrl": "https://your-hindsight-server.com",
  "hindsightApiToken": "your-token"
}
```

### 2. Local Daemon (auto-managed)

The plugin automatically starts and stops `hindsight-embed` via `uvx`. Requires an LLM provider API key for local fact extraction.

```json
{
  "hindsightApiUrl": "",
  "apiPort": 9077
}
```

Set an LLM provider:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key"      # Auto-detected, uses gpt-4o-mini
# or
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"       # Auto-detected, uses claude-3-5-haiku
```

### 3. Existing Local Server

If you already have `hindsight-embed` running, leave `hindsightApiUrl` empty and set `apiPort` to match your server's port. The plugin will detect it automatically.

## Configuration

All settings live in `~/.hindsight/claude-code.json`. Every setting can also be overridden via environment variables. The plugin ships with sensible defaults — you only need to configure what you want to change.

**Loading order** (later entries win):
1. Built-in defaults (hardcoded in the plugin)
2. Plugin `settings.json` (ships with the plugin, at `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/settings.json`)
3. User config (`~/.hindsight/claude-code.json` — recommended for your overrides)
4. Environment variables

---

### Connection & Daemon

These settings control how the plugin connects to the Hindsight API.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `hindsightApiUrl` | `HINDSIGHT_API_URL` | `""` (empty) | URL of an external Hindsight API server. When empty, the plugin uses a local daemon instead. |
| `hindsightApiToken` | `HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN` | `null` | Authentication token for the external API. Only needed when `hindsightApiUrl` is set. |
| `apiPort` | `HINDSIGHT_API_PORT` | `9077` | Port used by the local `hindsight-embed` daemon. Change this if you run multiple instances or have a port conflict. |
| `daemonIdleTimeout` | `HINDSIGHT_DAEMON_IDLE_TIMEOUT` | `0` | Seconds of inactivity before the local daemon shuts itself down. `0` means the daemon stays running until the session ends. |
| `embedVersion` | `HINDSIGHT_EMBED_VERSION` | `"latest"` | Which version of `hindsight-embed` to install via `uvx`. Pin to a specific version (e.g. `"0.5.2"`) for reproducibility. |
| `embedPackagePath` | `HINDSIGHT_EMBED_PACKAGE_PATH` | `null` | Local filesystem path to a `hindsight-embed` checkout. When set, the plugin runs from this path instead of installing via `uvx`. Useful for development. |

---

### LLM Provider (local daemon only)

These settings configure which LLM the local daemon uses for fact extraction. They are **ignored** when connecting to an external API (the server uses its own LLM configuration).

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `llmProvider` | `HINDSIGHT_LLM_PROVIDER` | auto-detect | Which LLM provider to use. Supported values: `openai`, `anthropic`, `gemini`, `groq`, `ollama`, `openai-codex`, `claude-code`. When omitted, the plugin auto-detects by checking for API key env vars in order: `OPENAI_API_KEY` → `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → `GEMINI_API_KEY` → `GROQ_API_KEY`. |
| `llmModel` | `HINDSIGHT_LLM_MODEL` | provider default | Override the default model for the chosen provider (e.g. `"gpt-4o"`, `"claude-sonnet-4-20250514"`). When omitted, the Hindsight API picks a sensible default for each provider. |
| `llmApiKeyEnv` | — | provider standard | Name of the environment variable that holds the API key. Normally auto-detected (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY` for the `openai` provider). Set this only if your key is in a non-standard env var. |

---

### Memory Bank

A **bank** is an isolated memory store — like a separate "brain." These settings control which bank the plugin reads from and writes to.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `bankId` | `HINDSIGHT_BANK_ID` | `"claude_code"` | The bank ID to use when `dynamicBankId` is `false`. All sessions share this single bank. |
| `bankMission` | `HINDSIGHT_BANK_MISSION` | generic assistant prompt | A short description of the agent's identity and purpose. Sent to Hindsight when creating or updating the bank, and used during recall to contextualize results. |
| `retainMission` | — | extraction prompt | Instructions for the fact extraction LLM — tells it *what* to extract from conversations (e.g. "Extract technical decisions and user preferences"). |
| `dynamicBankId` | `HINDSIGHT_DYNAMIC_BANK_ID` | `false` | When `true`, the plugin derives a unique bank ID from context fields (see `dynamicBankGranularity`), giving each combination its own isolated memory. |
| `dynamicBankGranularity` | — | `["agent", "project"]` | Which context fields to combine when building a dynamic bank ID. Available fields: `agent` (agent name), `project` (working directory), `session` (session ID), `channel` (channel ID), `user` (user ID). |
| `bankIdPrefix` | — | `""` | A string prepended to all bank IDs — both static and dynamic. Useful for namespacing (e.g. `"prod"` or `"staging"`). |
| `agentName` | `HINDSIGHT_AGENT_NAME` | `"claude-code"` | Name used for the `agent` field in dynamic bank ID derivation. |

---

### Auto-Recall

Auto-recall runs on every user prompt. It queries Hindsight for relevant memories and injects them into Claude's context as invisible `additionalContext` (the user doesn't see them in the chat transcript).

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `autoRecall` | `HINDSIGHT_AUTO_RECALL` | `true` | Master switch for auto-recall. Set to `false` to disable memory retrieval entirely. |
| `recallBudget` | `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_BUDGET` | `"mid"` | Controls how hard Hindsight searches for memories. `"low"` = fast, fewer strategies; `"mid"` = balanced; `"high"` = thorough, slower. Affects latency directly. |
| `recallMaxTokens` | `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_MAX_TOKENS` | `1024` | Maximum number of tokens in the recalled memory block. Lower values reduce context usage but may truncate relevant memories. |
| `recallTypes` | — | `["world", "experience"]` | Which memory types to retrieve. `"world"` = general facts; `"experience"` = personal experiences; `"observation"` = raw observations. |
| `recallContextTurns` | `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_CONTEXT_TURNS` | `1` | How many prior conversation turns to include when composing the recall query. `1` = only the latest user message; higher values give more context but may dilute the query. |
| `recallMaxQueryChars` | `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_MAX_QUERY_CHARS` | `800` | Maximum character length of the query sent to Hindsight. Longer queries are truncated. |
| `recallRoles` | — | `["user", "assistant"]` | Which message roles to include when building the recall query from prior turns. |
| `recallPromptPreamble` | — | built-in string | Text placed above the recalled memories in the injected context block. Customize this to change how Claude interprets the memories. |

---

### Auto-Retain

Auto-retain runs after Claude responds. It extracts the conversation transcript and sends it to Hindsight for long-term storage and fact extraction.

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `autoRetain` | `HINDSIGHT_AUTO_RETAIN` | `true` | Master switch for auto-retain. Set to `false` to disable memory storage entirely. |
| `retainMode` | `HINDSIGHT_RETAIN_MODE` | `"full-session"` | Retention strategy. `"full-session"` sends the full conversation transcript (with chunking). |
| `retainEveryNTurns` | — | `10` | How often to retain. `1` = every turn; `10` = every 10th turn. Higher values reduce API calls but delay memory capture. Values > 1 enable **chunked retention** with a sliding window. |
| `retainOverlapTurns` | — | `2` | When chunked retention fires, this many extra turns from the previous chunk are included for continuity. Total window size = `retainEveryNTurns + retainOverlapTurns`. |
| `retainRoles` | — | `["user", "assistant"]` | Which message roles to include in the retained transcript. |
| `retainToolCalls` | — | `true` | Whether to include tool calls (function invocations and results) in the retained transcript. Captures structured actions like file reads, searches, and code edits. |
| `retainTags` | — | `["{session_id}"]` | Tags attached to the retained document. Supports template placeholders: `{session_id}`, `{bank_id}`, `{timestamp}`, and `{user_id}` (resolved from `HINDSIGHT_USER_ID` env var; empty string if unset). Tags whose resolved form ends in an empty namespace part (e.g. `"user:"` when `HINDSIGHT_USER_ID` is unset) are dropped from the outgoing request. See [Template variables](#template-variables-for-retaintags-and-retainmetadata) below. |
| `retainMetadata` | — | `{}` | Arbitrary key-value metadata attached to the retained document. Same template placeholders as `retainTags`. |
| `retainContext` | — | `"claude-code"` | A label attached to retained memories identifying their source. Useful when multiple integrations write to the same bank. |

#### Template variables for `retainTags` and `retainMetadata`

| Variable | Source |
|----------|--------|
| `{session_id}` | Current Claude Code session ID |
| `{bank_id}` | Resolved bank ID (per `bankGranularity`) |
| `{timestamp}` | ISO 8601 UTC at retain time |
| `{user_id}` | Value of `HINDSIGHT_USER_ID` env var (empty string if unset) |

##### Example: per-user memory scoping

```json
{
  "retainTags": ["user:{user_id}", "session:{session_id}"]
}
```

Set `HINDSIGHT_USER_ID=<opaque-user-id>` in your shell profile (`.zshrc`,
`.bashrc`, etc.). If the env var is unset, the `user:` tag is dropped from the
outgoing retain request and the rest of the tags are sent as-is — so the same
`settings.json` works across machines whether you've set the env var or not.

Downstream, `recall` can filter by `tags=["user:alice"]` to isolate memories
authored by a specific user from a shared bank.

---

### Knowledge Tools

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `enableKnowledgeTools` | `HINDSIGHT_ENABLE_KNOWLEDGE_TOOLS` | `false` | Enable the MCP server with `agent_knowledge_*` tools. When `false`, the MCP server exits immediately on startup and no tools are registered. Set to `true` to enable knowledge page management, memory search, and document ingestion via MCP tools. |

---

### Debug

| Setting | Env Var | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `debug` | `HINDSIGHT_DEBUG` | `false` | Enable verbose logging to stderr. All log lines are prefixed with `[Hindsight]`. Useful for diagnosing connection issues, recall/retain behavior, and bank ID derivation. |

## Claude Code Channels

With [Claude Code Channels](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), Claude Code can operate as a persistent background agent connected to Telegram, Discord, Slack, and other messaging platforms. This plugin gives Channel-based agents the same long-term memory that `hindsight-openclaw` provides for Openclaw agents.

For Channel agents, set these environment variables in your Channel configuration:

```bash
# Per-channel/per-user memory isolation
export HINDSIGHT_CHANNEL_ID="telegram-group-12345"
export HINDSIGHT_USER_ID="user-67890"
```

And enable dynamic bank IDs:

```json
{
  "dynamicBankId": true,
  "dynamicBankGranularity": ["agent", "channel", "user"]
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin not activating

- Verify installation: check that `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` exists in the installed plugin directory
- Check Claude Code logs for `[Hindsight]` messages (enable `"debug": true` in `~/.hindsight/claude-code.json`)

### Recall returning no memories

- Verify the Hindsight server is reachable: `curl http://localhost:9077/health`
- Check that the bank has retained content: memories need at least one retain cycle
- Try increasing `recallBudget` to `"mid"` or `"high"`

### Daemon not starting

- Ensure `uvx` is installed: `pip install uv` or `brew install uv`
- Check that an LLM API key is set (required for local daemon)
- Review daemon logs: `tail -f ~/.hindsight/profiles/claude-code.log`
- Try starting manually: `uvx hindsight-embed@latest daemon --profile claude-code start`

### High latency on recall

- The recall hook has a 12-second timeout. If Hindsight is slow:
  - Use `recallBudget: "low"` (fewer retrieval strategies)
  - Reduce `recallMaxTokens`
  - Consider using an external API with a faster server

### State file issues

- State is stored in `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA/state/`
- To reset: delete the `state/` directory
- Turn counts, bank missions, and daemon state are tracked here

## Development

To test local changes to `hindsight-embed`:

```json
{
  "embedPackagePath": "/path/to/hindsight-embed"
}
```

The plugin will use `uv run --directory <path> hindsight-embed` instead of `uvx hindsight-embed@latest`.

To view daemon logs:

```bash
# Check daemon status
uvx hindsight-embed@latest daemon --profile claude-code status

# View logs
tail -f ~/.hindsight/profiles/claude-code.log

# List profiles
uvx hindsight-embed@latest profile list
```
