# CLI Reference

The Hindsight CLI provides command-line access to memory operations and bank management. All commands follow the [OpenAPI specification](/api-reference), so you can use `--help` on any command to see all available options.

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://hindsight.vectorize.io/get-cli | bash
```

## Configuration

Configure the API URL:

```bash
# Interactive configuration
hindsight configure

# Or set directly
hindsight configure --api-url http://localhost:8888

# With API key for authentication
hindsight configure --api-url http://localhost:8888 --api-key your-api-key

# Or use environment variables (highest priority)
export HINDSIGHT_API_URL=http://localhost:8888
export HINDSIGHT_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### Named Profiles

When you need to switch between multiple Hindsight deployments (e.g. local,
staging, production) without constantly rewriting `~/.hindsight/config`, use
named profiles. Each profile is a TOML file at
`~/.hindsight/cli-profiles/<name>.toml` and is selected per-invocation with
`-p/--profile` (or by setting `$HINDSIGHT_PROFILE`).

```bash
# Create (or overwrite) a profile
hindsight profile create prod \
  --api-url https://api.hindsight.vectorize.io \
  --api-key hsk_...

# List and inspect profiles
hindsight profile list
hindsight profile show prod

# Use a profile for a single command
hindsight -p prod bank list

# Or make it sticky for the current shell
export HINDSIGHT_PROFILE=prod
hindsight bank list

# Remove a profile
hindsight profile delete prod -y
```

Profile files are written with `0600` permissions on Unix so the API key is
only readable by the owner.

**Configuration precedence** (highest first):

1. Environment variables (`HINDSIGHT_API_URL`, `HINDSIGHT_API_KEY`)
2. Named profile — explicit `-p <name>`, otherwise `$HINDSIGHT_PROFILE`
3. Shared config file (`~/.hindsight/config`, written by `hindsight configure`)
4. Default (`http://localhost:8888`)

`HINDSIGHT_API_URL` / `HINDSIGHT_API_KEY` always override profile values, which
makes it safe to use `-p` in scripts while letting CI inject credentials via
environment.

## Core Commands

### Retain (Store Memory)

Store a single memory:

```bash
hindsight memory retain <bank_id> "Alice works at Google as a software engineer"

# With context
hindsight memory retain <bank_id> "Bob loves hiking" --context "hobby discussion"

# Queue for background processing
hindsight memory retain <bank_id> "Meeting notes" --async

# With an event date (ISO 8601 datetime or date)
hindsight memory retain <bank_id> "Project launched" --timestamp 2024-01-15

# Store without a timestamp (overrides the default of "now")
hindsight memory retain <bank_id> "Background fact" --timestamp unset
```

### Retain Files

Bulk import from files:

```bash
# Single file
hindsight memory retain-files <bank_id> notes.txt

# Directory (recursive by default)
hindsight memory retain-files <bank_id> ./documents/

# With context
hindsight memory retain-files <bank_id> meeting-notes.txt --context "team meeting"

# With a named retain strategy (see retain_strategies in bank config)
hindsight memory retain-files <bank_id> ./documents/ --strategy conversations

# Background processing
hindsight memory retain-files <bank_id> ./data/ --async
```

### Recall (Search)

Search memories using semantic similarity:

```bash
hindsight memory recall <bank_id> "What does Alice do?"

# With options
hindsight memory recall <bank_id> "hiking recommendations" \
  --budget high \
  --max-tokens 8192

# Filter by fact type
hindsight memory recall <bank_id> "query" --fact-type world,observation

# Filter by tags
hindsight memory recall <bank_id> "query" --tags work,project \
  --tags-match all

# Pin results to a specific time
hindsight memory recall <bank_id> "query" --query-timestamp "2026-01-15T00:00:00Z"

# Show trace information
hindsight memory recall <bank_id> "query" --trace
```

### Reflect (Generate Response)

Generate a response using memories and bank disposition:

```bash
hindsight memory reflect <bank_id> "What do you know about Alice?"

# With additional context
hindsight memory reflect <bank_id> "Should I learn Python?" --context "career advice"

# Higher budget for complex questions
hindsight memory reflect <bank_id> "Summarize my week" --budget high

# Filter by fact type
hindsight memory reflect <bank_id> "query" \
  --fact-types world,experience \
  --exclude-mental-models
```

### Memory History

View the observation history for a specific memory unit:

```bash
hindsight memory history <bank_id> <memory_id>
```

### Clear Observations

Remove all observations for a memory unit, keeping the core fact:

```bash
hindsight memory clear-observations <bank_id> <memory_id>

# Skip confirmation prompt
hindsight memory clear-observations <bank_id> <memory_id> -y
```

## Bank Management

### List Banks

```bash
hindsight bank list
```

### View Disposition

```bash
hindsight bank disposition <bank_id>
```

### Set Disposition

```bash
hindsight bank set-disposition <bank_id> --skepticism 3 --literalism 4 --empathy 5
```

### View Statistics

```bash
hindsight bank stats <bank_id>
```

### Set Bank Name

```bash
hindsight bank name <bank_id> "My Assistant"
```

### Set Mission

```bash
hindsight bank mission <bank_id> "I am a helpful AI assistant interested in technology"
```

### Clear Observations (Bank-wide)

Remove all observations across the entire bank:

```bash
hindsight bank clear-observations <bank_id>

# Skip confirmation prompt
hindsight bank clear-observations <bank_id> -y
```

### Recover Consolidation

Recover from a failed or stuck consolidation:

```bash
hindsight bank consolidation-recover <bank_id>
```

## Document Management

```bash
# List documents
hindsight document list <bank_id>

# Get document details

# Delete document and its memories
hindsight document delete <bank_id> <document_id>
```

## Entity Management

```bash
# List entities
hindsight entity list <bank_id>

# Get entity details
hindsight entity get <bank_id> <entity_id>
```

## Operation Management

Track and manage async operations (retain-files, consolidation, etc.):

```bash
# List operations
hindsight operation list <bank_id>

# Get operation status
hindsight operation get <bank_id> <operation_id>

# Cancel a pending operation
hindsight operation cancel <bank_id> <operation_id>

# Retry a failed operation
hindsight operation retry <bank_id> <operation_id>
```

## Webhook Management

Configure event delivery hooks for bank activity:

```bash
# List webhooks
hindsight webhook list <bank_id>

# Create a webhook (defaults to consolidation.completed events)
hindsight webhook create <bank_id> https://example.com/hook

# Create with specific events and signing secret
hindsight webhook create <bank_id> https://example.com/hook \

## Control Plane UI

Launch the web-based Control Plane UI directly from the CLI:

```bash
hindsight ui
```

This runs the Control Plane locally on port 9999 using the API URL from your configuration. The UI provides:

- **Memory bank management** — Browse and manage all your banks
- **Entity explorer** — Visualize the knowledge graph
- **Query testing** — Interactive recall and reflect testing
- **Operation history** — View ingestion and processing logs

:::tip
The UI command requires Node.js to be installed. It automatically downloads and runs the `@vectorize-io/hindsight-control-plane` package via npx.
:::

## Interactive Explorer

Launch the TUI explorer for visual navigation of your memory banks:

```bash
hindsight explore
```

The explorer provides an interactive terminal interface to:

- **Browse memory banks** — View all banks and their statistics
- **Search memories** — Run recall queries with real-time results
- **Inspect entities** — Explore the knowledge graph and entity relationships
- **View facts** — Browse world facts, experiences, and observations
- **Navigate documents** — See source documents and their extracted memories
