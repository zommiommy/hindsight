![Agent Memory Consolidation: Keep, Merge, Decay, Forget](/img/blog/agent-memory-consolidation.png)

Agent memory consolidation is the policy layer that decides what an agent's memory keeps, merges, or forgets. It operates on four levers: importance (what becomes a memory at all), merge (how facts about the same entity unify into one record), decay (how confidence in old facts degrades over time), and eviction (when a memory leaves the system entirely).

An agent that remembers everything is an agent that remembers nothing useful. Six months into production, a support assistant has logged every utterance from every user. It now confidently tells a customer they're still on Postgres, six weeks after they migrated to MySQL. Retrieval worked. The memory just wasn't right.

This is a consolidation problem, not a retrieval problem. Every long-running [agent memory](https://vectorize.io/what-is-agent-memory) system eventually needs a policy that decides what becomes a memory, how related facts get unified, how confidence in old facts degrades, and when memories leave the system entirely. Most agent memory systems are explicit about retrieval architecture and silent about consolidation policy. That silence is where production failures live.

This post lays out a four-lever framework for agent memory consolidation — importance, merge, decay, eviction — and walks through how [Mem0](https://mem0.ai), [Zep](https://www.getzep.com), [Letta](https://www.letta.com), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com), and Hindsight handle (or skip) each one.

## Why Agents Need to Forget

Three forces push every production agent memory system toward aggressive forgetting.

**Context economics.** At 128K-token windows and frontier-model pricing, stuffing the full conversation history into every prompt costs roughly an order of magnitude more per turn than retrieving a curated subset. The cost is real, but the bigger problem is attention dilution. Retrieved context that contains five contradictory facts about the same entity does not produce a coherent answer, even from a strong model.

**Entity drift.** Users change. Codebases change. The customer who used Postgres in January migrated to MySQL in March. If both facts sit in memory with equal weight, the agent will pick whichever one the retriever scored higher this turn. The right behavior is for the older fact to lose confidence as the newer one supersedes it.

**Index precision.** Retrieval quality degrades as the index grows. More documents mean more near-duplicates competing for the top-k slot, and more chances for a stale fact to outscore a current one. Forgetting is not just storage hygiene — it is the only way to keep retrieval precision stable over time.

A brief detour through cognitive science: humans forget on purpose. The Ebbinghaus forgetting curve and the complementary learning systems hypothesis (McClelland et al., 1995) both describe forgetting as an active process, not a failure of storage. The hippocampus stores episodes, the neocortex consolidates patterns, and most episodic detail is discarded along the way. That structure is the analogue for what production agent memory consolidation needs.

## The Four Levers of Memory Consolidation

Every consolidation policy operates on four levers:

1. **Importance** — Which observations become memories at all.
2. **Merge** — How related facts get unified into a single canonical record.
3. **Decay** — How confidence in a memory degrades over time.
4. **Eviction** — When a memory leaves the system entirely.

The rest of this post takes each lever in turn, then maps the major agent memory systems against the framework.

## Importance: What Becomes a Memory

The cheapest place to control agent memory quality is at write time. Everything that gets into the index has to be retrieved, reranked, and judged for relevance forever. The bar to enter should be high.

Two patterns dominate:

**LLM-rated importance scoring.** The pattern from Park et al.'s Generative Agents paper ([arxiv 2304.03442](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442)): rate each observation 1–10 on importance, store the score, and weight it into retrieval later. It works, but it adds a model call per write and the ratings drift across model versions. For high-throughput agents, it is expensive.

**Fact extraction as an importance filter.** Instead of rating raw turns, decompose conversations into atomic facts and only store the facts that survive extraction. This is Hindsight's approach: the write pipeline runs fact extraction, entity resolution, and reflect, and the extraction step is itself the importance filter. Conversational filler, repeated greetings, and procedural noise never become memories because they never become facts.

The trade-off cuts both ways. Aggressive importance filtering loses recall — useful context disappears before it can be retrieved. Permissive filtering pollutes the index and pushes the precision problem downstream into reranking. The right setting depends on whether your retrieval layer can recover precision at read time. If you have cross-encoder reranking, you can afford to keep more. If you don't, you have to be stricter at write time.

## Merge: Resolving the Same Thing Twice

The same entity gets referred to many ways. "Ben," "Ben Bartholomew," "the user," and "you" are all the same person. "The auth service," "our login system," and "the OAuth microservice" are all the same component. If memory stores these as separate records, retrieval will fragment and the agent will lose context across sessions.

Three pieces matter:

**Entity resolution.** Link mentions to a canonical entity ID. This has to happen at write time, not query time. Resolving at query time means every retrieval has to fan out across surface forms, which is expensive and unreliable.

**Fact deduplication.** Same claim, different wording. "Ben works at Vectorize" and "the user is employed by Vectorize" should collapse to one fact, not two.

**Conflict handling.** Same entity, contradictory claims. This is the hard case. Three sensible policies, and the right one depends on the domain:

- **Recency wins.** Newer facts supersede older ones. Good for state ("uses Postgres" → "uses MySQL"). Bad for stable attributes that might be re-asserted incorrectly.
- **Source wins.** Trusted sources override less-trusted ones. Good for systems with explicit provenance. Requires a trust model.
- **Confidence wins.** Each fact carries a confidence score, highest wins. Good when extraction is probabilistic. Requires calibration to avoid runaway certainty.

In practice, recency-wins with explicit invalidation is the most defensible default. When the user says "I migrated to MySQL," the system writes the new fact and marks the old one invalid rather than deleting it. Old state is recoverable for audit; current state is unambiguous for retrieval.

## Decay: Confidence Over Time

Decay is the lever most agent memory systems skip. It is also the one that matters most for long-running agents — and the lever where weak consolidation policy shows up first in production.

The premise is simple: not all facts age the same way. A user's stated preference from this morning is more reliable than the same preference from a year ago. A configuration claim from before a migration may still be in the index, but it should not be ranked as if it were current.

Three decay shapes are common:

- **Linear decay.** Confidence drops by a fixed amount per unit time. Easy to reason about, rarely matches reality.
- **Exponential decay.** Confidence halves on a timescale. Matches the Ebbinghaus curve and most cognitive-science models. A reasonable default.
- **Step-function decay.** Confidence stays flat until an external event invalidates it — a user contradiction, a system event, or a new conflicting fact.

Zep's Graphiti is the production system that takes decay most seriously, and it's worth being direct about it. Every edge in Zep's knowledge graph carries explicit temporal metadata: a `valid_at` timestamp, an `expired_at` timestamp when the fact has been superseded, and an `invalid_at` marker when it has been explicitly contradicted. This lets Zep answer questions most memory systems fumble: "What was the customer's address before they moved last October?" Hindsight supports temporal filtering as one of its four retrieval strategies, so it can handle "show me interactions from March," but Zep's fact-validity windows go deeper. If your agent's primary job is tracking how state evolves over time, that depth is hard to match.

The trade-off with decay is straightforward: it buys recency at the cost of stable long-term facts. Decay tuned too aggressively will forget a user's name; tuned too laxly will keep stale state forever. There is no universal right answer — it depends on the domain.

## Eviction: When Memories Leave

Eviction is the last lever, and the most irreversible. Once a memory is gone, it is gone. Three legitimate reasons to evict:

**Hard delete.** GDPR, user-requested forgetting, security incident, PII redaction. These are non-negotiable and should bypass all other policy.

**Archival tiering.** Letta's pattern: core memory stays in context, archival memory lives in vector storage, and the agent itself decides what moves between tiers using tool calls. This is closer to eviction-as-policy than true deletion — facts are still retrievable, just not in the prompt.

**TTL or LRU eviction.** Time-based or least-recently-used policies that bound index size. Cheap to implement, lossy in practice.

The "summarize then drop" pattern that LangChain's `ConversationSummaryMemory` popularized is technically eviction, but it is lossy compaction rather than consolidation. Summaries lose entity-level detail that retrieval depends on. They are a reasonable fallback when nothing better exists, not a substitute for the four-lever pipeline.

The practical rule: evict last. Importance filtering, merge, and decay are all reversible — you can re-tune the policy and re-process old data. Hard eviction is one-way. Almost every consolidation decision should be made by another lever before it reaches eviction.

## How the Major Systems Handle the Four Levers

No agent memory system covers all four levers well. Here is the honest map:

| System | Importance | Merge | Decay | Eviction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Mem0** | LLM-driven at write time | LLM-driven ADD/UPDATE/DELETE | None native | Explicit DELETE |
| **Zep / Graphiti** | Fact extraction | Entity-aware | Strong — temporal validity intervals | Explicit invalidation |
| **Letta** | Agent-decided | Agent-decided | None native | Tier transitions (core / archival) |
| **LangChain Memory** | Window or summary | None | None | Window eviction or summarize-and-drop |
| **Hindsight** | Fact extraction filter | LLM-powered consolidation | Recency boost at retrieval | None native |

Zep is the strongest decay system. Letta has the cleanest tier story. Mem0 has the most polished write-time operations API. LangChain's memory primitives are deprecated for a reason — they are compaction, not consolidation. Hindsight covers importance and merge well; it approximates decay through retrieval scoring rather than explicit confidence degradation. It does not do individual memory eviction — the design assumption is that LLM-powered consolidation and recency-weighted retrieval make stale facts effectively unretrievable, which holds for most workloads but not for compliance-driven deletion requirements.

## Evaluating a Consolidation Policy

How do you know your agent memory consolidation policy is right? Three signals matter.

**Multi-session reasoning accuracy.** LongMemEval ([Wu et al., arxiv 2410.10813](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10813)) tests exactly the kinds of questions consolidation policy gets right or wrong: tracking facts across sessions, handling contradictions, reasoning about temporal claims. On the LongMemEval-s split tracked by the public [Agent Memory Benchmark](https://agentmemorybenchmark.ai/) leaderboard, Hindsight scores 94.6%, SuperMemory scores 81.6%, Zep scores 71.2%, and Mem0 scores 67.6%. Several newer research systems — Chronos at 95.6%, Mastra at 92.8%, Honcho at 90.4% — sit at or above Hindsight, and the spread across the leaderboard is wide. The point isn't where any single system ranks today; it's that the gap between the bottom and top reflects retrieval architecture, but it reflects consolidation policy just as much. A system that stores every turn raw and retrieves with vector similarity alone will score poorly even if its embeddings are excellent.

**Contradiction-detection accuracy.** Synthetic test: inject a state change ("user migrated from Postgres to MySQL on March 14"), then ask the agent about current state a week later. The right answer is MySQL. Systems with no decay or no merge will return Postgres, or "both, depending on the query."

**Token cost per turn.** A consolidation policy that works will keep per-turn token usage flat as the index grows. If your token cost climbs linearly with session count, the policy is letting noise accumulate.

What to log in production: per-turn retrieval count, per-turn token usage, entity-resolution merge rate, fact-invalidation events, and retrieval cache hit rate. A regression in any of these is an agent memory consolidation regression in disguise.

## Practical Defaults

If you are designing or evaluating an agent memory system, this is the order to think in:

1. **Start with fact-level storage, not turn-level.** Extracting facts at write time is the highest-leverage consolidation decision. Everything downstream gets easier.
2. **Do entity resolution at write time.** Resolving at query time fragments the index and slows every retrieval. Pay the cost once on write.
3. **Add decay only when you have temporal claims worth decaying.** If your agent does not track state changes, exponential decay just throws away stable facts.
4. **Eviction last.** Almost everything else is reversible. Hard eviction is not.

The first three of these defaults are roughly what Hindsight ships with out of the box; Hindsight does not implement hard eviction, trading that lever for simplicity. The checklist still applies to any agent memory system: when a vendor cannot answer how their system handles one of the four levers, you have found the failure mode you will hit in production.

## The Four Levers as a Checklist

The next time you evaluate an agent memory system, ask four questions about its consolidation policy:

1. What becomes a memory, and what does not?
2. How does the system know two facts are about the same thing?
3. How does confidence in old facts degrade?
4. When and why does a memory leave the system?

If the answer to any of these is "the LLM decides at write time" or "we don't model that," you have found where your production agent will quietly drift. Retrieval scores are the easy part. The hard part is the policy layer that decides what should have survived to be retrieved in the first place.

Hindsight is a strong implementation of the first three levers — importance, merge, and retrieval-based decay — without hard eviction. The architecture — fact extraction, LLM-powered consolidation, multi-strategy retrieval, cross-encoder reranking — is documented at [hindsight.vectorize.io](https://hindsight.vectorize.io), and the source is MIT-licensed on GitHub. Whether you build your own agent memory consolidation policy or pick something off the shelf, the four levers are the right shape of the problem.
