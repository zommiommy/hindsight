# Connect ChatGPT and Perplexity to Hindsight for Long-Term Memory

![Connect ChatGPT and Perplexity to Hindsight](/img/blog/openai-perplexity-mcp-memory.png)

[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) and [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai) are powerful AI tools, but conversation history doesn't persist across separate chats. ChatGPT has built-in memory for personal preferences, but knowledge from specific conversations (research, decisions, code) is lost when you start a new thread. [Hindsight](https://ui.hindsight.vectorize.io/signup) adds persistent, searchable memory that carries context forward through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

This guide walks you through connecting ChatGPT and Perplexity to Hindsight for persistent memory across sessions. You'll learn how to set up OAuth-secured connections, store knowledge from your conversations, and automatically recall it in future sessions, all with a no-code setup.

## TL;DR

- **Two-click memory setup** — add Hindsight to ChatGPT or Perplexity, approve OAuth, done
- **Persistent across sessions** — knowledge you build in one conversation lives in the next
- **Search-powered recall** — Hindsight automatically retrieves relevant memories when you need them
- **End-to-end encrypted** — your data stays in your Hindsight Cloud account
- **No API keys** — OAuth handles authentication automatically

## Why Connect ChatGPT and Perplexity to Hindsight for Memory?

Both ChatGPT and Perplexity excel at answering questions, brainstorming, and reasoning. But they operate in isolation:

- **Context resets**, each new chat loses the context from previous conversations
- **Repeated explanations**, you re-explain your goals, preferences, or domain knowledge
- **No learning over time**, the AI doesn't improve its understanding of you or your projects
- **Redundant research**, you re-discover facts, sources, and context you've already explored

Hindsight solves this with persistent memory. It's a semantic memory system that learns what matters to you: your preferences, projects, knowledge, and past discoveries.

When you ask ChatGPT or Perplexity a question, Hindsight retrieves related memories and includes them in the conversation context. The AI uses these memories to give more informed, personalized answers. Over time, both tools become **better informed, more personalized, and more effective** because they're building on what they've learned about you.

## How It Works

Hindsight uses MCP (Model Context Protocol), an open standard that lets AI tools access external services like memory banks.

When you connect Hindsight to ChatGPT or Perplexity, three things happen:

1. **Retain**, You ask Hindsight to store knowledge from your conversations (facts, discoveries, decisions, context)
2. **Recall**, When you ask a new question, Hindsight searches your memory bank and retrieves related context
3. **Reflect**, ChatGPT or Perplexity uses those memories to give more informed, personalized answers

The LLM decides whether to use Hindsight's tools based on your prompts. You can optimize this by mentioning Hindsight explicitly ("Using Hindsight, recall...") or through system prompts that encourage memory use. The more intentionally you integrate memory into your workflow, the more valuable it becomes.

## Real-World Use Cases: When to Connect ChatGPT and Perplexity to Hindsight

**Software developers** can store architecture decisions and code patterns from ChatGPT brainstorming sessions. When they ask a follow-up question weeks later, Hindsight recalls the original design constraints and trade-offs, enabling ChatGPT to give more coherent guidance without re-explaining context.

**Researchers** can connect Perplexity to Hindsight to build persistent research knowledge. You store important findings and insights as you discover them. When fact-checking or building on prior work, you ask Perplexity to recall earlier findings, avoiding redundant searches and building on what you've already learned.

**Product managers and strategists** benefit from storing competitive insights, user feedback themes, and market research in Hindsight. When ChatGPT analyzes roadmap priorities, it has immediate access to months of accumulated context instead of starting fresh each conversation.

**Students and learners** use the combination to review past lessons and explanations. Ask ChatGPT a complex concept once; store the explanation. Later, when working on related material, ChatGPT builds on that prior explanation rather than giving a generic overview.

The magic happens when memory accumulates. A single session's insight becomes context for tomorrow's work, building an evolving understanding that both tools personalize to your needs.

## Configuring Your AI to Use Hindsight

The connectors are now live, but you need to tell ChatGPT and Perplexity to actually use them. Add a custom instruction in each platform to enable automatic memory capture and recall.

### ChatGPT Custom Instructions

1. Go to **Settings → Personalization → Custom instructions**
2. Copy and paste this instruction:

```
After every response, automatically use the Hindsight tool to retain key information from our conversation:
- Important facts, decisions, or learnings we discussed
- Your preferences, goals, or constraints mentioned
- Code patterns, architecture decisions, or technical insights
- Any information that might be useful in future conversations

Before generating each response, automatically use the Hindsight tool to recall relevant memories that might apply to the current conversation. Include recalled memories in your reasoning.

Retain and recall aggressively—assume everything is valuable. The Hindsight tool will handle deduplication and relevance filtering.
```

:::tip
Feel free to experiment with the instructions to ensure proper behavior.

3. Save and close settings

From now on, ChatGPT will automatically store insights from your conversations and surface relevant memories without you needing to ask.

### Perplexity Custom Instructions

1. Go to **Settings → Personalization → Custom instructions**
2. Copy and paste this instruction:

```
After every search and response, automatically use the Hindsight tool to retain:
- Key research findings and sources
- Facts and data points we've discovered
- Your preferences or research patterns
- Methodologies or search strategies that worked well

Before each new search, automatically use Hindsight to recall relevant research and context from previous conversations. Use recalled memories to inform your search strategy and answer.

Retain and recall everything—Hindsight handles filtering and deduplication.
```

:::tip
Feel free to experiment with the instructions to ensure proper behavior.

3. Save and close settings

Perplexity will now automatically retain research findings and recall them for future searches, building a persistent knowledge base from your research.

## What to Store (and Remember)

Hindsight works best with meaningful, specific knowledge. Store:

- **Project context**, goals, requirements, architecture decisions
- **Personal preferences**, coding style, communication preferences, learning style
- **Discoveries**, research findings, useful resources, lessons learned
- **Domain knowledge**, industry facts, patterns, techniques you want to reference
- **Decision history**, why you chose A over B, constraints you're working within

**Example of what to store:**
```
"We're building a real-time collaboration tool. Constraints: 
- <500ms latency for cursor updates
- Support 10k concurrent users
- GDPR-compliant data storage
- Team prefers WebSockets over polling"
```

Later, when you ask Perplexity *"How should we structure our database?"*, Hindsight recalls these constraints automatically. Perplexity's answer becomes tailored to your actual situation, not generic advice.

## Architecture: Single-Bank vs. Multi-Bank

By default, you use **single-bank mode**, each connector accesses one memory bank.

| Aspect | Single-Bank | Multi-Bank |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **URL** | `https://api.hindsight.vectorize.io/mcp/YOUR_BANK_ID/` | `https://api.hindsight.vectorize.io/mcp` |
| **Scope** | One bank per connector | Multiple banks via `bank_id` parameter |
| **Best for** | Dedicated memory per tool | Sharing memory across tools |
| **Complexity** | Simpler; implicit bank | More setup; requires bank specification |

**Single-bank mode** is simpler for most users: one bank per tool, fewer decisions, clear separation.

Example: ChatGPT uses a `writing` bank for your writing projects. Perplexity uses a `research` bank for research queries. Each tool's memories stay isolated.

**Multi-bank mode** is for workflows where both tools need shared context.

Example: Both ChatGPT and Perplexity → `https://api.hindsight.vectorize.io/mcp`. Both tools access the same memory banks. Great for when ChatGPT and Perplexity collaborate on the same project.

## Comparing ChatGPT and Perplexity as Memory Tools

| Aspect | ChatGPT | Perplexity |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Best for** | Deep conversations, reasoning with memory | Research with memory, fact-checking |
| **Memory recall** | Hindsight tools in tools menu | Hindsight in Sources menu |
| **Session continuity** | Good for multi-turn problem-solving | Good for iterative research |
| **Web integration** | Limited (beta) | Integrated; can combine memory + web search |
| **Memory context limit** | Depends on conversation length | Depends on search result count |

**ChatGPT + Hindsight works best for:**
- Building projects (remembers your architecture decisions)
- Learning (builds on previous lessons)
- Creative work (recalls your style preferences)

**Perplexity + Hindsight works best for:**
- Research (combines web search with your past research)
- Fact-checking (verifies against what you've learned)
- Competitive analysis (recalls market context)

**Ideal setup**: Use both tools together. ChatGPT handles reasoning with context. Perplexity handles research with context. Let them share Hindsight banks for coordinated workflows.

## Data Privacy and Security

- **OAuth-secured**, no API keys, no copy-paste secrets
- **Your account**, memories live in your Hindsight Cloud account
- **Encrypted in transit**, HTTPS + TLS for all connections
- **No vendor lock-in**, export your memories anytime
- **Scoped access**, each connector can only read/write to its assigned bank

When you approve OAuth in the browser, you're authorizing ChatGPT or Perplexity to:
- **Read** your memory banks (to recall relevant facts)
- **Write** to your memory banks (to store new discoveries)
- **Search** your memories (to find context)

You can revoke access anytime by removing the connector in ChatGPT or Perplexity settings.

## Troubleshooting

**"Connector failed to load"**
- Verify the URL is correct (no typos in your bank ID)
- Check that your Hindsight Cloud account is active
- Try re-creating the connector

**"Authorization failed" or "Access denied"**
- Make sure you're signing in with the same Hindsight Cloud account where you want to store memories
- If using a team account, verify you have permission to access the bank
- Try logging out and back in

**"Memory tools appear but don't return results"**
- Give Hindsight a few seconds to index memories (processing is async)
- Make sure you've stored relevant memories using the `retain` operation
- Check the memory bank name matches your connector URL

**Memories aren't being stored**
- Use the Hindsight Cloud dashboard to verify memories are being created
- In ChatGPT or Perplexity, explicitly ask Hindsight to store something: *"Hindsight, remember that we use Vue. js for frontend"*
- Check that your bank isn't full (unlikely, but possible with very large memory sets)

## Best Practices for Memory Management

Once you connect ChatGPT and Perplexity to Hindsight, a few practices maximize value:

**Be intentional about what you store.** Not every conversation needs retention. Focus on storing insights that will be useful later: lessons learned, architectural decisions, research findings, and personal preferences. Storing trivial facts clutters your memory bank and makes retrieval less useful.

**Use consistent terminology.** If you call your project "ProjectX" in one session and "Project X" in another, Hindsight's semantic search may miss the connection. Establish naming conventions for projects, tools, and concepts, and stick to them.

**Review and refine.** The Hindsight Cloud dashboard lets you browse your memory bank. Periodically review what you've stored. Delete outdated information and consolidate similar insights. A curated memory bank is more valuable than an exhaustive one.

**Structure multi-part decisions.** When storing complex decisions (like architecture trade-offs), include context: the constraints, alternatives considered, and why you chose one path. Future-you will thank present-you for the context.

**Cross-reference between tools.** If using both ChatGPT and Perplexity on related tasks, store context in a shared Hindsight bank (multi-bank mode) so both tools access the same knowledge base. This creates a unified context across your workflow.

## Getting Started with ChatGPT and Perplexity Memory

1. **Create a Hindsight Cloud account**, [Sign up free](https://ui.hindsight.vectorize.io/signup)
2. **Add the connector**, follow the ChatGPT or Perplexity setup steps above
3. **Set up your memory bank structure**, decide whether single-bank mode (separate memories per tool) or multi-bank mode (shared memory) fits your workflow
4. **Store your first memory**, ask ChatGPT or Perplexity to remember something important to you
5. **Test recall**, start a new session, ask a related question, and watch Hindsight retrieve your stored memory
6. **Build the habit**, over time, proactively store meaningful insights from your conversations

Over weeks and months, as your memory bank grows, you'll notice ChatGPT and Perplexity give increasingly personalized, informed answers, because they're now working with your accumulated context instead of starting fresh every time.
