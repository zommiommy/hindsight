![Your Claude Code Subagents Don't Share What They Learn](/img/blog/claude-code-subagents-memory.png)

[Claude Code's subagent system](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents) is one of the best things to ship in the harness layer this year. You can delegate work to specialized agents — `Plan` to think through a strategy, `Explore` to crawl the codebase, `general-purpose` to handle a multi-step task, or any custom subagent you define under `.claude/agents/`. Each one runs in its own context, with its own system prompt and tools, and reports back when it's done.

It's a clean delegation model. By default, it's also amnesiac in a specific way: every subagent invocation starts fresh, and even when you opt into the persistence features Claude Code does ship, knowledge stays siloed inside each subagent.

Whatever the subagent figures out — the file it found, the architectural pattern it noticed, the dead end it hit, the decision the user made mid-task — vanishes the moment it returns. The orchestrator gets back a final message. Everything else evaporates.

If you have ever launched the same `Explore` agent twice in a row to find a thing it already found, you have hit this. If you have ever watched two parallel subagents independently discover the same constraint, you have hit this. If you have ever wondered why your custom code-review subagent never seems to learn what your team actually cares about, you have hit this.

## TL;DR

- Claude Code subagents (Plan, Explore, general-purpose, and custom subagents under `.claude/agents/`) start fresh on every invocation by default
- Claude Code does ship two partial answers — the `memory` field (per-subagent persistent directory) and experimental subagent resume via `SendMessage` — but neither solves the *cross-subagent* sharing problem
- Each subagent's `memory` directory is siloed from every other subagent's. The code-reviewer doesn't see what the security-auditor learned, and vice versa.
- A shared memory layer (Hindsight on a single project bank) gives every subagent — plus the orchestrator — one common, accumulating understanding
- The pattern mirrors filesystem-vs-memory: per-subagent `MEMORY.md` files are a hard drive; a shared learning bank is closer to a memory
- [Hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight) is the memory layer; the [hindsight-memory plugin](https://hindsight.vectorize.io/integrations) wires it into Claude Code's session hooks automatically

## What Subagents Already Do Well

Subagents are not the problem. They are an answer to a real one.

A single Claude Code session has limits. The context window fills up. Long exploration tasks generate noise that crowds out the work. Specialized work — planning, searching, code review, security analysis — benefits from a focused system prompt that doesn't have to coexist with the orchestrator's general instructions.

Subagents solve all of that. They give you:

- **Fresh context per task.** Big exploration jobs don't poison the orchestrator's working memory.
- **Specialized prompts and tools.** A code-reviewer subagent can have stricter tool permissions and a tighter system prompt than the parent.
- **Parallelism.** Multiple subagents can run independently, returning their summaries when done.
- **A clean return protocol.** The orchestrator gets a final message it can act on. No babysitting.

That model works. It is also exactly the model that makes the memory gap unavoidable.

---

## What Disappears When A Subagent Returns

The subagent runs in its own loop. It reads files. It greps. It calls tools. It forms hypotheses. It rules things out. It makes intermediate decisions about what is worth pursuing. It writes a final message and exits.

The orchestrator receives the final message. Everything else is gone.

That includes:

- **The exploration trail.** Which files the subagent opened, which it ruled out, what it grepped for and didn't find.
- **The intermediate decisions.** "I tried approach X, it didn't work because of Y, so I switched to Z."
- **The implicit conventions discovered.** "All HTTP handlers in this repo use the `withAuth` wrapper, even though it's not in the README."
- **The dead ends.** The five things the subagent considered and rejected, which a future subagent might walk straight back into.

For a single one-shot task, none of that matters — the final message captures the relevant outcome. For any work that involves more than one subagent invocation over time, all of that is information you generated and then threw away.

---

## What Claude Code Already Does (And Where It Stops)

Claude Code is not unaware of this. It ships two mechanisms that partially address subagent persistence — both worth knowing about, neither sufficient for cross-subagent shared understanding.

**The `memory` field.** A subagent's YAML frontmatter can include `memory: project` (or `user`, or `local`). When set, Claude Code gives that subagent a persistent directory — `~/.claude/agent-memory/<name>/` for `user` scope, `.claude/agent-memory/<name>/` for `project` — and auto-injects the first 200 lines of `MEMORY.md` from that directory into the system prompt on each invocation. The subagent gets Read/Write/Edit tools enabled so it can curate its own notes over time.

This is real persistence and a real win for tasks where the same subagent does the same kind of work repeatedly. The catch: every subagent has its **own** memory directory. Your `code-reviewer` subagent's `MEMORY.md` is invisible to your `security-auditor` subagent, and vice versa. Knowledge accumulates per-subagent, not across them. It is also a markdown file — the same filesystem-as-memory pattern we critiqued for `CLAUDE.md`. There's no synthesis, no relevance ranking, no mental model. Just files the subagent reads on startup and edits when prompted.

**Subagent resume via `SendMessage`.** Experimental, gated behind `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`. When enabled, Claude can resume a specific subagent by ID and the subagent picks up its full conversation history — every prior tool call, result, and reasoning step. Subagent transcripts persist independently of main-conversation compaction and survive across Claude Code restarts (by resuming the parent session).

This is the right answer when you want to continue *one* subagent's in-progress work. It does not address the case where many subagents — different kinds, across different sessions — should share one accumulating understanding of your project.

So Claude Code's native answers solve "this subagent should remember its own past." They don't solve "all my subagents should share a common, growing understanding of what we've learned together."

## Where The Pain Shows Up

This is not theoretical. The patterns repeat:

### Two Explore agents, one codebase

You launch an `Explore` subagent on Monday to find every place the auth middleware is used. It returns a clean summary. You launch a different `Explore` subagent on Tuesday to find every place the user model is constructed. The second agent re-greps half the same files, re-discovers the same auth wrapper, and reports back as if for the first time.

The first agent's exploration could have shortcut the second agent's. Nothing carries over.

### Parallel subagents that collide

You spawn three subagents in parallel to investigate three related questions. Each one independently rediscovers the same architectural quirk in your codebase. You get three slightly different framings of the same observation in three returned messages, and the orchestrator has to reconcile them.

If they shared memory, the second and third agents would have started from "the first agent already noted this; what else is true?"

### The custom subagent that never learns your team's preferences

You wrote a `code-reviewer` subagent in `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`. It does a fine job on the first PR. On the second PR, it flags the same lint pattern your team explicitly decided not to enforce. On the third PR, it argues for a refactor pattern you rejected last sprint.

You can update the system prompt to capture those decisions. But you have to remember to do it, and you have to do it manually. The subagent itself learned nothing from the first two PRs.

### The orchestrator that has to re-instruct every time

The orchestrator knows things from the conversation. The subagent it just spawned knows nothing about that conversation. So the orchestrator has to repeat context in the subagent prompt — again, every time. That eats orchestrator tokens and still doesn't carry over to the *next* subagent.

---

## What Changes With Shared Memory

A shared memory layer — one bank that the orchestrator reads from and writes to as the session runs — flips the model. Instead of N siloed `MEMORY.md` files, one per subagent, you get a single learning layer everything draws from.

Now the picture looks like this:

- The orchestrator pulls relevant memories before each turn and brings that context into the prompts it sends subagents
- The full session transcript — orchestrator turns plus every subagent's tool results — gets retained back to the same bank when the turn ends
- The next subagent (in this session or the next one) inherits everything that was previously retained, surfaced through the orchestrator

The first `Explore` agent's findings are available to the second one — because they were captured in the prior session's transcript and surface again on the next relevant prompt. The custom `code-reviewer` subagent inherits the preferences your team accumulated over previous reviews — because the orchestrator recalls them and includes them in the review brief. Parallel subagents stop colliding because they're delegated from an orchestrator that already knows what the project has settled on.

The orchestrator stops spending tokens re-explaining the same context every session. It pulls it from the bank.

This is not a small ergonomic win. It is the difference between subagents being a delegation primitive and subagents being a *team*.

## Setting It Up

The integration is intentionally low-effort. The [hindsight-memory plugin](https://hindsight.vectorize.io/integrations) for Claude Code uses the standard [hook architecture](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks):

- `SessionStart` — health check on the memory bank
- `UserPromptSubmit` — auto-recall relevant memories before the model is called
- `Stop` — auto-retain the session transcript when the turn ends
- `SessionEnd` — cleanup

The hooks fire at the **session level**, not inside subagent loops. That sounds like a limitation but is actually what makes the design clean for shared memory:

- **Recall** happens once on the orchestrator's turn — the orchestrator picks up relevant context *before* it decides to delegate. Whatever it knows from memory is then carried into the subagent prompt it constructs via the `Task` tool. The subagent inherits context indirectly, through the orchestrator, without needing its own hooks.
- **Retain** runs at the orchestrator's `Stop`, after subagents have finished and returned. It reads the full session JSONL transcript, which captures every subagent's tool results and final messages. So everything a subagent did or discovered ends up in the bank — no per-subagent wiring needed.

The net effect is what you want: subagents benefit from accumulated learning (orchestrator-mediated on the way in, full-transcript-captured on the way out) and you only configure one set of hooks.

A typical project setup lives at `~/.hindsight/claude-code.json`:

```json
{
  "bankId": "my-project",
  "autoRecall": true,
  "autoRetain": true
}
```

The `bankId` is the shared identity — every session in this project, and every subagent it spawns, writes to and reads from `my-project`. If you want per-project, per-user, or per-channel isolation, set `dynamicBankId: true` and configure `dynamicBankGranularity` (e.g. `["agent", "project"]` or `["user"]`). The [memory bank reference](https://hindsight.vectorize.io/developer/api/memory-banks) covers the patterns; the same set of hooks supports all of them.

That is the entire setup. After a few sessions of normal work, you can run a subagent against this bank and watch the orchestrator surface preferences and decisions a previous subagent figured out, in a previous session.

## A Concrete Before/After

Before:

> **Orchestrator:** Use the Explore agent to find every place we call the Stripe webhook handler.
>
> *(Explore agent grep, opens 12 files, returns: "Found 7 call sites. They're all in `src/billing/`. The handler signature is `(req, res) => Promise<void>`, and 5 of the 7 wrap calls in our `withSpan` tracing helper.")*
>
> **Orchestrator:** Now use the Explore agent to find every place we call the Slack webhook handler.
>
> *(Explore agent grep, opens 11 files, returns: "Found 4 call sites. They're all in `src/notifications/`. The handler signature is `(req, res) => Promise<void>`, and 3 of the 4 wrap calls in our `withSpan` tracing helper.")*

The second exploration learns nothing from the first. The shared `withSpan` pattern is rediscovered from scratch.

After:

> **Orchestrator:** Use the Explore agent to find every place we call the Slack webhook handler.
>
> *(Explore agent recalls from shared bank: "We have a project-wide convention of wrapping webhook handlers in `withSpan`, last observed in the Stripe webhook exploration. Confirm this holds.")*
>
> *(Explore agent grep, opens 4 files, returns: "Found 4 call sites in `src/notifications/`. Convention holds — 3 of 4 wrap in `withSpan`. The 4th is a known exception in the Slack retry path; flagging for review.")*

Same task, half the exploration, more useful answer. The second agent built on the first.

## What This Looks Like Across A Week

Memory effects compound. After a week of normal subagent use against a shared bank, you start to notice:

- Repeated explorations stop being repetitive
- The orchestrator stops needing to re-paste context into subagent prompts
- Custom subagents (code-reviewer, security-checker, doc-writer) get measurably better at matching your team's preferences without you editing their system prompts
- New sessions don't feel like cold starts — the project's accumulated understanding is already there

For solo work, it feels like the harness finally remembers. For team setups where multiple people use Claude Code on the same project bank, it feels like the agents are working off a shared brain instead of independent re-derivations.

---

## A Quick Note on What's Coming

The current model is: Hindsight retains and recalls memory; you (or your subagents) read and write it through the bank.

The next step is closer to genuinely self-improving agents. Soon, Hindsight will be able to **write directly back to the markdown files that shape agent behavior** — [`CLAUDE.md`](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory), custom subagent prompts under `.claude/agents/`, even [skills](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/skills). As the agent learns your team's conventions and decisions, those learnings get reflected into the static files the next session loads. You stop maintaining `CLAUDE.md` by hand. The agent maintains it for you, based on what it has actually observed.

That is one piece of a broader self-driving-agents push we will say more about soon. For now, the shared-memory layer is the part that's available today and the part that gives you the immediate compounding effect.

## Tradeoffs and Limits

Shared memory is not always the right choice. A few honest tradeoffs:

- **Bank scope matters.** A single bank shared across unrelated projects creates noise. Use one bank per project, or one bank per team where appropriate. The [memory bank reference](https://hindsight.vectorize.io/developer/api/memory-banks) covers the patterns.
- **Sensitive context.** If a subagent is reading customer data, think carefully about what gets retained. The plugin's retention is configurable; you can keep specific data out of the bank.
- **Single-shot work.** If you almost never use subagents and your sessions are isolated, the value is lower. Memory pays off when work is iterative.
- **The first few days.** A new bank is empty. The compounding effect kicks in once a few sessions have built it up — usually within a week of normal use.
- **You may not need shared memory.** If you only use one type of subagent and it works alone, Claude Code's native `memory` field may be enough on its own — a per-subagent `MEMORY.md` it curates over time. Hindsight is the right answer when you have multiple subagents that should share understanding, when you want learning memory rather than file-based notes, or when the same knowledge needs to surface across both the orchestrator and its subagents.

These are not deal-breakers, just things to size for. For most Claude Code users running multiple subagents regularly, the right answer is one project bank with auto-retain and auto-recall on.

## Recap

- Claude Code subagents start fresh on every invocation by default; only the final message returns to the orchestrator
- Claude Code's native `memory` field gives a subagent its own persistent `MEMORY.md` — useful, but each subagent's directory is siloed from every other subagent's
- `SendMessage` resume (experimental) lets you continue *one* subagent's work, but doesn't address the shared-knowledge case
- Without a shared layer, sibling subagents collide and sequential subagents re-derive what their predecessors found
- One shared Hindsight bank gives every subagent and the orchestrator a common, growing understanding — instead of N siloed `MEMORY.md` files
- The hindsight-memory plugin uses Claude Code's session hooks, so subagents inherit access to the shared bank with no per-subagent wiring
- Self-improving behavior — including agents that update their own `CLAUDE.md` — is the next layer; shared memory is the foundation it sits on

Subagents are how Claude Code scales beyond one context window. A shared memory bank is how those subagents stop being strangers to each other.
