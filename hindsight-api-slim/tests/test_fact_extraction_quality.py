"""
Test suite for fact extraction quality verification.

This comprehensive test suite validates that the fact extraction system:
1. Preserves all information dimensions (emotional, sensory, cognitive, etc.)
2. Correctly converts relative dates to absolute dates
3. Properly classifies facts as agent vs world
4. Makes logical inferences to connect related information
5. Correctly attributes statements to speakers
6. Filters out irrelevant content (podcast intros/outros)

These are quality/accuracy tests that verify the LLM-based extraction
produces semantically correct and complete facts.
