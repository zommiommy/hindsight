"""
Test suite for fact extraction quality verification.

This comprehensive test suite validates that the fact extraction system:
1. Preserves all information dimensions (emotional, sensory, cognitive, etc.)
2. Correctly converts relative dates to absolute dates
3. Properly classifies facts as agent vs world
4. Makes logical inferences to connect related information
5. Correctly attributes statements to speakers
6. Filters out irrelevant content (podcast intros/outros)

Every test here exercises real LLM extraction behaviour — the file is marked
hs_llm_core at module scope so it runs in the single-provider quality CI job.
MockLLM cannot simulate dimension preservation, date conversion, or pronoun
resolution; running these tests against a mock would either pass spuriously
(MockLLM echoes input text, so string assertions trivially succeed) or fail
with no diagnostic signal.

Semantic assertions go through tests.llm_judge so paraphrases survive — the
LLM might phrase preserved emotion as "elated" instead of "thrilled", and a
literal substring check would flake.  Structural assertions (date fields,
fact counts, fact_type classification) stay as direct asserts.

subscribe and leave a rating.

Marcus: Today I want to talk about my research on interpretability in AI systems.
I've been working on this for about a year now.

Jamie: That sounds really interesting! What made you focus on that area?

Marcus: I believe it's crucial for AI safety. We need to understand how these
models make decisions before we can trust them in critical applications.

Jamie: I completely agree with that approach.

Marcus: Well, I think that's gonna do it for us today! Thanks for listening everyone.
