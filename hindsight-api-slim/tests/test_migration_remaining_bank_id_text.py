"""Regression for the issue #2106 follow-up: the live ``bank_id`` columns must
not truncate on PostgreSQL.

``c3e5a7b9d1f4`` widened the *history* tables to ``TEXT``, but ``directives`` and
``mental_models`` kept their original ``VARCHAR(64)`` ``bank_id`` while
``banks.bank_id`` is ``TEXT``. A bank_id longer than 64 chars (the 78-char shape
reported in #2106) can create the bank but then 500s with
``StringDataRightTruncation`` on the next write to those tables.

This test migrates a dedicated pg0 instance to head, asserts both columns are
``TEXT``, then writes a >64-char bank_id through every widened table. Uses a
dedicated pg0 instance (mirrors test_migration_history_long_bank_id) so the
migrated schema is well defined.

``mental_model_versions`` is deliberately excluded: it is dropped on the upgrade
path (``o0j1k2l3m4n5``) and does not exist at head, so the migration must not
touch it.
