"""Tests for hindsight_api.engine.db_utils.

Regression coverage for the single-yield contract of ``acquire_with_retry`` —
historically a retry loop wrapped the ``yield`` and caused every retryable
user-code exception to surface as
``RuntimeError("generator didn't stop after athrow()")``, masking the real
cause and producing identical failed-op rows in production (see the 1,934
failed consolidations on ``shurick-memory`` in May 2026).
