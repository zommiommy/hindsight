"""
Regression tests for the consolidation retry path.

When a consolidation task hits a transient error, the worker's generic retry
path raises ``RetryTaskAt`` to re-queue the operation (memory_engine.py, see
``execute_task``'s exception branch). Two pieces of behaviour live there:

1. **Dedup guard.** During a long upstream outage, every retain on the same
   bank enqueues a fresh consolidation op via ``submit_async_consolidation``.
   Without dedup, each op independently consumes its own retry budget,
   multiplying load on the broken dependency. The guard: if another
   consolidation op is already ``pending`` for the same bank when the retry
   decision is made, skip the retry and let the other op cover the work.

2. **Indefinite retry with capped exponential backoff** (60s, 120, 240, 480,
   960, 1800-cap). Distinct from the generic 60s × 3 used by other task
   types. Transient consolidation failures (LLM/DB outage) must eventually
   recover; capping after a fixed number of attempts silently dead-letters
   the bank's backlog. The dedup-by-bank guard above prevents a retry
   storm when multiple ops exist for the same bank.
