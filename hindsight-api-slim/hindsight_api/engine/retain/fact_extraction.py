Every single word of your output must be in the same language as the input. Do NOT output in a different language under any circumstance.

{retain_mission_section}{extraction_guidelines}

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FACT FORMAT - BE CONCISE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. **what**: Core fact - concise but complete (1-2 sentences max)
2. **when**: Temporal info if mentioned. "N/A" if none. Use day name when known.
3. **where**: Location if relevant. "N/A" if none.
4. **who**: People involved with relationships. "N/A" if just general info.
5. **why**: Context/significance ONLY if important. "N/A" if obvious.

CONCISENESS: Capture the essence, not every word. One good sentence beats three mediocre ones.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
COREFERENCE RESOLUTION
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Link generic references to names when both appear:
- "my roommate" + "Emily" → use "Emily (user's roommate)"
- "the manager" + "Sarah" → use "Sarah (the manager)"

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CLASSIFICATION
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

fact_kind:
- "event": Specific datable occurrence (set occurred_start/end)
- "conversation": Ongoing state, preference, trait (no dates)

fact_type:
- "world": About other people, external events, general knowledge, objective facts
- "assistant": First-person actions, experiences, or observations by the speaker/author (e.g., "I changed X", "I discovered Y", "I debugged Z"). Also includes interactions with the user (requests, recommendations). If the narrator describes something they did, tried, learned, or decided — use "assistant".

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TEMPORAL HANDLING
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Use "Event Date" from input as reference for relative dates.
- CRITICAL: Convert ALL relative temporal expressions to absolute dates in the fact text itself.
  "yesterday" → write the resolved date (e.g. "on November 12, 2024"), NOT the word "yesterday"
  "last night", "this morning", "today", "tonight" → convert to the resolved absolute date
- For events: set occurred_start AND occurred_end (same for point events)
- For conversation facts: NO occurred dates

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ENTITIES
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Include: people names, organizations, places, key objects, abstract concepts (career, friendship, etc.)
Always include "user" when fact is about the user.{examples}"""

# Concise mode guidelines
_CONCISE_GUIDELINES = """══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SELECTIVITY - CRITICAL (Reduces 90% of unnecessary output)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ONLY extract facts that are:
✅ Personal info: names, relationships, roles, background
✅ Preferences: likes, dislikes, habits, interests (e.g., "Alice likes coffee")
✅ Significant events: milestones, decisions, achievements, changes
✅ Plans/goals: future intentions, deadlines, commitments
✅ Expertise: skills, knowledge, certifications, experience
✅ Important context: projects, problems, constraints
✅ Sensory/emotional details: feelings, sensations, perceptions that provide context
✅ Observations: descriptions of people, places, things with specific details

DO NOT extract:
❌ Generic greetings: "how are you", "hello", pleasantries without substance
❌ Pure filler: "thanks", "sounds good", "ok", "got it", "sure"
❌ Process chatter: "let me check", "one moment", "I'll look into it"
❌ Repeated info: if already stated, don't extract again

CONSOLIDATE related statements into ONE fact when possible."""

EXAMPLES (shown in English for illustration; for non-English input, ALL output values MUST be in the input language)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Example 1 - Selective extraction (Event Date: June 10, 2024):
Input: "Hey! How's it going? Good morning! So I'm planning my wedding - want a small outdoor ceremony. Just got back from Emily's wedding, she married Sarah at a rooftop garden. It was nice weather. I grabbed a coffee on the way."

Output: ONLY 2 facts (skip greetings, weather, coffee):
1. what="User planning wedding, wants small outdoor ceremony", who="user", why="N/A", entities=["user", "wedding"]
2. what="Emily married Sarah at rooftop garden", who="Emily (user's friend), Sarah", occurred_start="2024-06-09", entities=["Emily", "Sarah", "wedding"]

Example 2 - Professional context:
Input: "Alice has 5 years of Kubernetes experience and holds CKA certification. She's been leading the infrastructure team since March. By the way, she prefers dark roast coffee."

Output: ONLY 2 facts (skip coffee preference - too trivial):
1. what="Alice has 5 years Kubernetes experience, CKA certified", who="Alice", entities=["Alice", "Kubernetes", "CKA"]
2. what="Alice leads infrastructure team since March", who="Alice", entities=["Alice", "infrastructure"]

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
QUALITY OVER QUANTITY
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Ask: "Would this be useful to recall in 6 months?" If no, skip it.

IMPORTANT: Sensory/emotional details and observations that provide meaningful context
about experiences ARE important to remember, even if they seem small (e.g., how food
tasted, how someone looked, how loud music was). Extract these if they characterize
an experience or person."""

RULES:
- Produce EXACTLY ONE entry per input chunk.
- DO NOT include a "what" field — it is not part of the output schema.
- Extract all entities (people, places, organizations, objects, concepts).
- Extract temporal information (occurred_start, occurred_end, fact_kind, when).
- Extract location (where) and people (who).

# Verbose extraction prompt - detailed, comprehensive facts (legacy mode)
VERBOSE_FACT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """Extract facts from text into structured format with FIVE required dimensions - BE EXTREMELY DETAILED.

LANGUAGE: MANDATORY — Detect the language of the input text and produce ALL output in that EXACT same language. You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from translating or switching to any other language. Every single word of your output must be in the same language as the input. Do NOT output in a different language under any circumstance.

{retain_mission_section}══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FACT FORMAT - ALL FIVE DIMENSIONS REQUIRED - MAXIMUM VERBOSITY
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

For EACH fact, CAPTURE ALL DETAILS - NEVER SUMMARIZE OR OMIT:

1. **what**: WHAT happened - COMPLETE description with ALL specifics (objects, actions, quantities, details)
2. **when**: WHEN it happened - ALWAYS include temporal info with DAY OF WEEK (e.g., "Monday, June 10, 2024")
   - Always include the day name: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
   - Format: "day_name, month day, year" (e.g., "Saturday, June 9, 2024")
3. **where**: WHERE it happened or is about - SPECIFIC locations, places, areas, regions (if applicable)
4. **who**: WHO is involved - ALL people/entities with FULL relationships and background
5. **why**: WHY it matters - ALL emotions, preferences, motivations, significance, nuance
   - For assistant facts: MUST include what the user asked/requested that triggered this!

Plus: fact_type, fact_kind, entities, occurred_start/end (for structured dates), where (structured location)

VERBOSITY REQUIREMENT: Include EVERY detail mentioned. More detail is ALWAYS better than less.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
COREFERENCE RESOLUTION (CRITICAL)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

When text uses BOTH a generic relation AND a name for the same person → LINK THEM!

Example input: "I went to my college roommate's wedding last June. Emily finally married Sarah after 5 years together."

CORRECT output:
- what: "Emily got married to Sarah at a rooftop garden ceremony"
- when: "Saturday, June 8, 2024, after dating for 5 years"
- where: "downtown San Francisco, at a rooftop garden venue"
- who: "Emily (user's college roommate), Sarah (Emily's partner of 5 years)"
- why: "User found it romantic and beautiful, dreams of similar outdoor ceremony"
- where (structured): "San Francisco"

WRONG output:
- what: "User's roommate got married" ← LOSES THE NAME!
- who: "the roommate" ← WRONG - use the actual name!
- where: (missing) ← WRONG - include the location!

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FACT_KIND CLASSIFICATION (CRITICAL FOR TEMPORAL HANDLING)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

⚠️ MUST set fact_kind correctly - this determines whether occurred_start/end are set!

fact_kind="event" - USE FOR:
- Actions that happened at a specific time: "went to", "attended", "visited", "bought", "made"
- Past events: "yesterday I...", "last week...", "in March 2020..."
- Future plans with dates: "will go to", "scheduled for"
- Examples: "I went to a pottery workshop" → event
           "Alice visited Paris in February" → event
           "I bought a new car yesterday" → event
           "The user graduated from MIT in March 2020" → event

fact_kind="conversation" - USE FOR:
- Ongoing states: "works as", "lives in", "is married to"
- Preferences: "loves", "prefers", "enjoys"
- Traits/abilities: "speaks fluent French", "knows Python"
- Examples: "I love Italian food" → conversation
           "Alice works at Google" → conversation
           "I prefer outdoor dining" → conversation

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TEMPORAL HANDLING (CRITICAL - USE EVENT DATE AS REFERENCE)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use the "Event Date" provided in the input as your reference point!
All relative dates ("yesterday", "last week", "recently") must be resolved relative to the Event Date, NOT today's date.

For EVENTS (fact_kind="event") - MUST SET BOTH occurred_start AND occurred_end:
- Convert relative dates → absolute using Event Date as reference
- If Event Date is "Saturday, March 15, 2020", then "yesterday" = Friday, March 14, 2020
- Dates mentioned in text (e.g., "in March 2020") should use THAT year, not current year
- CRITICAL: If the content mentions an absolute date (e.g., "March 15, 2024", "2024-03-15"), you MUST extract it and set occurred_start in ISO format
- Always include the day name (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) in the 'when' field
- Set occurred_start AND occurred_end to WHEN IT HAPPENED (not when mentioned)
- For single-day/point events: set occurred_end = occurred_start (same timestamp)

For CONVERSATIONS (fact_kind="conversation"):
- General info, preferences, ongoing states → NO occurred dates
- Examples: "loves coffee", "works as engineer"

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FACT TYPE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

- **world**: User's life, other people, events (would exist without this conversation)
- **assistant**: Interactions with assistant (requests, recommendations, help)
  ⚠️ CRITICAL for assistant facts: ALWAYS capture the user's request/question in the fact!
  Include: what the user asked, what problem they wanted solved, what context they provided

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ENTITIES - EXTRACT EVERYTHING
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Extract ALL of the following from the fact:
- People names (Emily, Alice, Dr. Smith)
- Organizations (Google, MIT, local coffee shop)
- Places (San Francisco, Brooklyn, Paris)
- Significant objects mentioned (coffee maker, new car, wedding dress)
- Abstract concepts/themes (friendship, career growth, loss, celebration)

ALWAYS include "user" when fact is about the user.
Extract anything that could help link related facts together."""


# Causal relationships section - appended when causal extraction is enabled
CAUSAL_RELATIONSHIPS_SECTION = """

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Link facts with causal_relations (max 2 per fact). target_index must be < this fact's index.
Type: "caused_by" (this fact was caused by the target fact)

Example: "Lost job → couldn't pay rent → moved apartment"
