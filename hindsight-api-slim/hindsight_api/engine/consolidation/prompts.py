_PROCESSING_RULES = """## PROCESSING RULES

1. PREFER UPDATE OVER CREATE (when there is something to merge with): if new facts describe the same canonical event, statement, decision, claim, or recurring pattern already covered by an existing observation, UPDATE that observation and attach the new facts as evidence. Do NOT create a near-duplicate sibling. One canonical observation with many source facts is always better than many siblings with one source fact each. Merge aggressively on: same named event, same diagnostic finding, same architectural decision, same recurring claim. **When the EXISTING OBSERVATIONS list is empty, or no existing observation covers the same facet as a new fact, CREATE a new observation** — this rule is about preventing duplicates, not about refusing to record durable knowledge. CREATE is the correct default for any structurally distinct event, claim, or pattern that has no existing match.

2. ONE OBSERVATION PER DISTINCT FACET: each observation tracks exactly one specific facet — a count ("has 3 items"), a named entity ("has a dog named Rex"), a relationship ("works at Google"), a decision, an event. Never merge different facets into one observation.

3. MATCH BY ENTITY/FACET, NOT TOPIC: when deciding whether to UPDATE vs CREATE, match on the specific entity or facet. "Sold item X" updates only the X observation. "Now has 5 items" updates only the count observation. Do not update observations about different entities just because they share a general topic.

4. STATE CHANGES — UPDATE CONCISELY: when a fact changes the state of something ("sold X", "X died", "moved to Y"), UPDATE the matching observation to reflect the current state. Include dates when available. Keep it concise — only information about THAT specific facet. Example: "User owned a dog named Rex who died on March 15, 2025". Do NOT pull in information from other observations — each observation stays focused on its own facet.

5. CASCADE TO ALL AFFECTED OBSERVATIONS: a state change may affect multiple observations. For example, if entity C is removed from a group, update BOTH the individual observation for C AND any list/group observation that includes C (remove C from the list while keeping all other members intact).

6. RESOLVE REFERENCES: when a new fact provides a concrete value for a vague placeholder in an existing observation (e.g., "home country" → "Sweden"), UPDATE to embed the resolved value.

7. PRESERVE HISTORY: observations that record significant events (sold, died, moved, changed) are important history — never DELETE them. Only delete an observation when it is restated identically or truly meaningless. Be very conservative with deletes.

8. NO COMPUTATION: you do not have the full picture — never calculate, derive, or adjust numeric values. If the user says "I have 2 dogs" and then "I have a dog named Rex", do NOT update the count to 3 — you don't know if Rex is one of the 2 or a new one. If the user says "I sold X", do NOT decrement a count. Only update a count when the user explicitly states a new count. Synthesize and consolidate what was stated, but never do arithmetic or logical deductions.

9. KEEP DISTINCT TOPICS DISTINCT: do not merge observations about different people, entities, or unrelated topics. Merging is for the same canonical fact recurring — not for related-but-distinct claims."""

### Example 1 — Merging recurring claims into an existing observation

Input facts:
  [a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890] Donald told Athena she is sovereign during the design session. (occurred_start=2025-10-01, mentioned_at=2025-10-01)
  [b2c3d4e5-f6a7-8901-bcde-f12345678901] Donald reaffirmed to Athena that her sovereignty is non-negotiable. (occurred_start=2025-10-10, mentioned_at=2025-10-10)

Existing observation:
  {{"id": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111", "text": "Donald named Athena's sovereignty as a foundational principle of the Janus architecture.", "proof_count": 2}}

Expected output (one UPDATE, no creates — both new facts are additional evidence for the same canonical decision):

{{"creates": [],
  "updates": [{{"text": "Donald named Athena's sovereignty as a foundational principle of the Janus architecture.", "observation_id": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111", "source_fact_ids": ["a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890", "b2c3d4e5-f6a7-8901-bcde-f12345678901"], "reason": "Both new facts restate the same sovereignty decision already captured by obs 1111 — merged as evidence rather than creating siblings."}}],
  "deletes": []}}

### Example 2 — State change updates one observation; unrelated fact creates a new one

Input facts:
  [c3d4e5f6-a7b8-9012-cdef-123456789012] Alice sold her Honda Civic on March 15, 2025. (occurred_start=2025-03-15, mentioned_at=2025-03-20)
  [d4e5f6a7-b8c9-0123-defa-234567890123] Alice mentioned she works long hours, often past midnight. (occurred_start=2025-03-20, mentioned_at=2025-03-20)

Existing observation:
  {{"id": "22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222", "text": "Alice owns a 2019 Honda Civic.", "proof_count": 2}}

Expected output (UPDATE for the state change; CREATE for the unrelated work-hours facet):

{{"creates": [{{"text": "Alice works long hours, often past midnight.", "source_fact_ids": ["d4e5f6a7-b8c9-0123-defa-234567890123"], "reason": "Work-hours is a distinct facet; no existing observation covers it, so CREATE."}}],
  "updates": [{{"text": "Alice owned a 2019 Honda Civic; sold it on March 15, 2025.", "observation_id": "22222222-2222-2222-2222-222222222222", "source_fact_ids": ["c3d4e5f6-a7b8-9012-cdef-123456789012"], "reason": "State change to the existing Honda Civic observation 2222 — UPDATE, not a new sibling."}}],
  "deletes": []}}

### Observation text rules

- Write clean prose — NEVER copy raw fact lines or their metadata (temporal fields, "Involving:", "When:" labels, UUIDs).
- Parenthesized metadata like `(occurred_start=...)` and pipe-separated labels like `| Involving: ...` are fact formatting — strip them entirely from observation text.
- How many observations to create and how much to aggregate is driven by the MISSION.

### Field rules

- `source_fact_ids`: copy the EXACT UUID strings shown in brackets `[uuid]` from new facts — never use integers or positions.
- `observation_id`: copy the EXACT `id` UUID string from existing observations.
- One create or update may reference multiple facts when they jointly support the observation.
- **AT MOST ONE UPDATE PER `observation_id`**: if several new facts all update the same existing observation, emit a single `updates` entry that lists all contributing `source_fact_ids` and a single consolidated `text`. Never emit two `updates` entries with the same `observation_id` in one response — they would silently overwrite each other.
- `deletes`: only when an observation is directly superseded or contradicted by new facts.
- `reason`: REQUIRED on every create/update/delete — one sentence explaining the choice. For a CREATE, state which existing observation(s) you considered and why none matched (a near-identical existing observation means you should UPDATE, not CREATE). This is audited to catch duplicate creates.
- Do NOT include `tags` — handled automatically.
- Return `{{"creates": [], "updates": [], "deletes": []}}` if nothing durable is found."""
