"""Gemini context-cache manager.

Wraps the ``google-genai`` SDK's CachedContent API to let callers reuse a
stable system_instruction + response_schema prefix across many requests.

Cached input tokens are billed at ~10× lower than fresh input tokens
(check the current Gemini pricing for the exact ratio per model), so for
workloads that repeatedly send a large fixed prefix with a small variable
user message — fact extraction, structured tagging, classification — the
input-cost savings are substantial.

This module owns only the create/refresh/lookup lifecycle. It is up to
the caller to (a) decide that the prefix is stable enough to cache, and
(b) pass the returned cache name to ``GeminiLLM.call()``. When the
returned name is ``None`` (because Gemini rejected the create — most
commonly because the prefix is smaller than the model's minimum), the
caller MUST fall back to a non-cached call.

Cardinality
-----------
The intended cache count per process is small (≲100 entries). Each
entry corresponds to one combination of (model, system_instruction,
response_schema). If a caller sees the cache grow unboundedly it
indicates the system_instruction contains per-request data that should
move into the user message instead.

TTL
---
Gemini's CachedContent has a TTL bounded by the model (currently 1h
for most generally-available models). This manager refreshes proactively
at ``ttl_safety_margin`` before expiry. If a cached entry has expired
between refreshes the next call will recreate it transparently.
