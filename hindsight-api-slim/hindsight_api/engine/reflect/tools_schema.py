Tool schema definitions for the reflect agent.

These are OpenAI-format tool definitions used with native tool calling.
The reflect agent uses a hierarchical retrieval strategy:
1. search_mental_models - User-curated stored reflect responses (highest quality, if applicable)
2. search_observations - Consolidated knowledge with freshness awareness
3. recall - Raw facts (world/experience) as ground truth fallback
