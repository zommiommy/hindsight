"""
Database migration management using Alembic.

This module provides programmatic access to run database migrations
on application startup. It is designed to be safe for concurrent
execution using PostgreSQL advisory locks to coordinate between
distributed workers.

Supports multi-tenant schema isolation: migrations can target a specific
PostgreSQL schema, allowing each tenant to have isolated tables.

Important: All migrations must be backward-compatible to allow
safe rolling deployments.

No alembic.ini required - all configuration is done programmatically.
