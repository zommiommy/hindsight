"""Add graph_maintenance_queue table

Generic queue for post-mutation graph maintenance work. The first ``kind``
of work — ``relink_unit`` — holds the unit IDs that lost an outgoing
temporal/semantic link when a neighbour memory_unit was deleted; an async
worker probes for replacement neighbours and restores the link counts.

The (bank_id, kind, target_id) shape is deliberately generic so other
post-delete cleanup tasks (orphan entity pruning, stale cooccurrence
removal, etc.) can ride on the same queue and worker dispatch instead of
each spawning its own task type.
