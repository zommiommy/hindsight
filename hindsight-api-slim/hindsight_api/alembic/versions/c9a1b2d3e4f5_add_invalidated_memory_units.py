"""Add invalidated_memory_units table for curation (edit/invalidate).

Curation keeps the recall hot-path (``memory_units``) clean by *moving*
invalidated facts into a sibling archive table rather than flagging them in
place. If a row is in ``memory_units`` it is live; if it is in
``invalidated_memory_units`` it has been retired. Recall/consolidation/graph
queries never need a state predicate — the rows simply aren't there.

The archive mirrors ``memory_units`` column-for-column (so a row round-trips
losslessly on revert) plus:
- ``invalidation_reason``  optional free text recorded on invalidate
- ``invalidated_at``       when it was retired
- ``entity_ids``           snapshot of the unit's entity associations, so revert
                           can restore them (``unit_entities`` is cascade-deleted
                           when the live row is removed)

This migration also adds ``edited_at`` to ``memory_units``: set whenever a user
edits a memory's fields (text, context, dates, fact_type, entities) via curation.
NULL means never manually modified; a non-NULL value answers "has the user ever
changed this?" with the time of the last edit (distinct from ``updated_at``,
which background operations also bump). It is added to ``memory_units`` *before*
the archive is cloned below, so the archive inherits the column and the marker
travels with a fact when it is invalidated.
