"""
Large-bank recall load test (no LLM).

Populates a synthetic bank using the real retain pipeline with a mocked LLM
for fact extraction, then benchmarks recall latency at production scale.

Supports two modes:
  - In-process (default): uses MemoryEngine directly with mock LLM
  - HTTP (--api-url): calls a remote Hindsight API (e.g., Docker container)

Usage (run from hindsight-api/):
    cd hindsight-api

    # Generate a small bank (~10K memory units):
    uv run python ../hindsight-dev/benchmarks/perf/recall_perf.py generate \\
        --bank-id recall-perf-small2 --scale small

    # Benchmark recall (in-process):
    uv run python ../hindsight-dev/benchmarks/perf/recall_perf.py benchmark \\
        --bank-id recall-perf-small --query "database migration" --iterations 5

    # Reproduce the slow temporal recall (PR #1958): generate a bank whose memories
    # all cluster on one date, then force the temporal arm with a window on that date:
    uv run python ../hindsight-dev/benchmarks/perf/recall_perf.py generate \\
        --bank-id recall-perf-temporal --scale very-large --event-date 2025-01-15
    uv run python ../hindsight-dev/benchmarks/perf/recall_perf.py benchmark \\
        --bank-id recall-perf-temporal --query "database migration" \\
        --temporal-date 2025-01-15 --iterations 5

    # Benchmark recall (HTTP, against Docker):
    uv run python ../hindsight-dev/benchmarks/perf/recall_perf.py benchmark \\
        --bank-id recall-perf-small --query "database migration" --iterations 5 \\
        --api-url http://localhost:8080

    # Clean up:
    uv run python ../hindsight-dev/benchmarks/perf/recall_perf.py clean \\
        --bank-id recall-perf-small
