"""
Common benchmark runner framework based on the LoComo implementation.

This module provides a unified interface for running benchmarks with the same
optimizations as the working LoComo benchmark:
- Batch ingestion for speed
- Parallel question processing with semaphores
- Parallel LLM judging with rate limiting
- Progress tracking with Rich
- Comprehensive metrics collection
- Support for both traditional (search + LLM) and integrated (think API) approaches

The framework supports two answer generation patterns:
1. Traditional: Benchmark runner performs search, then passes results to answer generator
2. Integrated: Answer generator performs its own retrieval (e.g., think API)
   - Indicated by needs_external_search() returning False
   - Skips the search step for efficiency
