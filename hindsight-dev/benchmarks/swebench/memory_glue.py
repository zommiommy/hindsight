"""Hindsight memory glue for the SWE-bench study.

One :class:`MemoryGlue` instance owns a single Hindsight bank that persists across a
*consecutive* sequence of tasks on one repository. Before each task the agent recalls
durable codebase knowledge; after each task we distil the trajectory into a few durable
facts and retain them. The control arm uses ``enabled=False`` — zero recall/retain calls,
so the only difference between arms is the memory content.

Talks to the Hindsight Cloud dev instance over the HTTP API via the local
``hindsight_client`` SDK. The API token is read from the environment only
(``HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN``) — never hard-coded.
