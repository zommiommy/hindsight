"""Authoritative resolve scoring via the official SWE-bench evaluation harness.

We never hand-judge a patch. Each arm's ``preds.json`` (the mini-swe-agent format, a dict
keyed by instance_id) is fed to ``swebench.harness.run_evaluation`` in Docker, which applies
the patch and runs the repo's FAIL_TO_PASS / PASS_TO_PASS tests. We parse the resulting
``<model>.<run_id>.json`` report into ``{instance_id: resolved_bool}``.
